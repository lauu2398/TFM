Within this repository, you will discover three key files essential to the project:

1. **choosing_backbone.py**: This file houses the code responsible for selecting the backbone architecture crucial to our project's framework. The backbone serves as the foundational structure upon which our subsequent model developments are built. 

2. **finetuning.py**: Here, in this file, resides the process of fine-tuning our models. Fine-tuning is a critical step in machine learning where pre-trained models are further trained on specific data to enhance their performance for a particular task. In this context, our models undergo refinement to adapt them to the nuances of our project's objectives, ensuring optimal learning and adaptation. The training has been done with all the data colect from Google.

3. **classification_true_labels.py**: This file encompasses the code dedicated to evaluating our model's performance under ideal conditions, where all data is accurately labeled. This evaluation is crucial for understanding  how far is the model develop in this project (with the constrain of low amount of data) compared with the top we can achieve.
